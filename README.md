# Edge-detection-from-scratch
Repository contains basic image processing algorithms for smoothing (with a Gaussian kernel), edge detection using Sobel filters and non-maximum suppression with hysteresis. This code is a great way to understand the process of image filtering and edge detection as it does not make use of functions that can be found in Open-CV.
